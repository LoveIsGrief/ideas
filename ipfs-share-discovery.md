It should be possible to host a website that allows discovering and indexing the contents on IPFS.

Users should be able to tag, comment and rate content on IPFS. The website itself might even be hostable on ipfs and act as a mirror. Nothing would be downloadable from it, just the meta-information about IPFS. The actual content would just be a link to the actual IPFS data.
