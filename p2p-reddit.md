# Challenges

Once everyone becomes a server, things become pretty difficult when security and privacy are to be considered.

## Moderation

It's debatable if one would even want to give others the possibility to modify your content. Illegal content however, could be a problem. What were to happen if illegal content were to be posted e.g child pornography, private documents, etc. ?

One possibility would be to allow users to flag content and every node could choose whether it should continue hosting that content or not.

## Updating and deleting your content

This is a form of moderation on oneself. If moderation is implemented, this could work in the same fashion for deleting content.

How would updating content work?

## Vote manipulation

Lots of things would need to be accounted for:

* Account creation
* Posting content
* Voting

# Tech

Existing technologies we could use to implement this.

## Blockchain

A blockchain \(possibly with contracts\) could be used for preventing abuse like spamming the network with accounts, posts, comments or votes. Those kind of actions could be bound to computational requirements.

Saving the posts and comments / content on the blockchain might not be a good idea as we wouldn't want to force people download the whole blockchain just to start commenting.

## IPFS

For storing data. It can track versions of comments and posts, but do we really want to do that? Maybe another tech were better suited for this task? Another distributed datastore...
