# Why

IMDB doesn't support HTTPS and it doesn't seem as if they ever will. The issue on their forum hasn't gotten any responses [for 3 years](https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/https-support). That's a bit much.

There's no need to support such a disregard for privacy.

## [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)?

Yeah, they aren't free, but at least they have HTTPS and all I need are watchlists to keep track of stuff I'd like to watch and stuff I'd like to avoid.

# How

* The Movie DB has an [API](https://developers.themoviedb.org)
* IMDB doesn't have one with user auth, but users can export their playlists as CSV

Parse CSV and create watchlists on TMBD
