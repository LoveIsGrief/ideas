# Source of the idea

[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is an extension that lets you save links, pages, articles, images and even videos on the cloud to be read later. 

All those entries can be tagged and thus sorted and searched. This allows you to browse what others have been pocketing and have you own kind of feed.

# The idea

It would be great if all this were to be done in a P2P fashion without the need for a service.

Private pockets could be encrypted and the public ones simply wouldn't be. 

# Possible problems

## Bad tags

Tagging pockets with incorrect tags could pollute your feed. Thus, there should be a way to filter out posts that

*  haven't been tagged as often
  * recently --&gt; only follow trending stuff
  * after a certain time --&gt; only follow stuff that has trended for a while since it would be easy to share a script that pockets a certain distasteful page using the help of many participants, makes it into trending and pollutes the feed
  * ever --&gt; e.g a year later is still pocketed by many users and has been read by many users
* are by certain users or groups
